I'm trying to migrate apis from Java to NestJS.

I need to read the type/schema/entity from Java and convert it to NestJS API.

I have 2 services one is API Gateway and the other is Hotel Service (microservice).

example to send message to Microservice:

@Injectable()
export class XService {
  constructor(
    @Inject(PLATFORM_SERVICE) private readonly hotelClient: ClientProxy // keep the same this name
  ) {}

  xMethod(query: XQueryDto) {
    return this.hotelClient.send({ cmd: "x_method" }, query);
  }
}

dtos folders include each api query or body

not include ApiPropertyOptional ApiProperty anymore in dto


Perfect! I understand your coding style now. This is a much cleaner approach:

viết trong 1 hàm duy nhất, logic query sử dụng find etc của typeorm chứ ko dùng builder
